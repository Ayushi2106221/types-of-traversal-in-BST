as we know there are three types of traversal in binary search tree
1- In order traversal
2- Pre order traversal
3- Post order traversal

In Inorder traversal we do traverse in the below way
left-root-right

In Preorder traversal we do traverse in the below way
root-left-right

In Postorder traversal we do traverse in the below way
left-right-root
